# Mastermind2018

This algorithm and its implementation in two different languages (Prolog and Erlang) was a homework project for the course Declarative Programming in 2018. The task can be read [here](https://dp.iit.bme.hu/dp18a/dp18a-nhf.html)

I think, that my solution is based on simple ideas, still it has produced acceptable times on evaluation as well. The solution suits Prolog better, so that source code is easier to understand first. (Erlang basicly does the same, but I had to use some workarounds.)

The full documentation of the solution is available in Hungarian.
